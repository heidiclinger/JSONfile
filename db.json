Arizona alone has 17 dark-sky places, which is more than any other country in the world. Why is it so important that we protect our nighttime views of the starry sky? Why should we turn out the lights at night and can we learn to enjoy the darkness? This presentation will explore the importance of dark skies from a philosophical perspective. Some philosophers argue that the darkness of night is a gift that helps to restore our moral sense. We will discuss what connections can be found between darkness and the night sky with our sense of morality, our sense of who we are as human beings and our understanding of our place in the universe.",
